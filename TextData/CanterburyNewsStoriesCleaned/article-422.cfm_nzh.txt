Richard Ballantyne has been lauded for his efforts in driving business and industry in Christchurch and helping to rebuild the city after its quakes.

He has been made a companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to business and the community.

Ballantyne has been a major part of iconic department store Ballantynes for more than 40 years, 16 of which he was managing director.

He stepped back into a board role just as the quakes hit and took the opportunity to help rebuild the city.

Ballantyne is on the board of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce.

He is also a life member of and past president of the national Retailers Association and a member of the Institute of Management, Institute of Directors and Institute of Chartered Accountants.

As well as giving back to the business world he is very active in the wider community.

He sits on the boards of the Cholmondeley Foundation, which supports a children's home, and the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra.

Ballantyne is passionate about the welfare of central Christchurch as the region's cultural and commercial heart and backs Canterbury's sustainable development and potential.

He is married with three adult children and enjoys gardening, fly fishing and golf.
