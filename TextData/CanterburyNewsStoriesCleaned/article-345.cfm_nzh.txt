The first trailer for an upcoming feature-length film documenting Christchurch's devastating earthquakes has debuted online.

Directed by Gerard Smyth, When a City Falls examines the aftermath of the region's massive quakes on September 4, 2010, and February 22, 2011.

The second quake destroyed Christchurch's central city, decimated many buildings and killed 181 people. The repair bill is estimated at billions of dollars, and residents still suffer regular aftershocks.

The trailer, released today, comes ahead of the film's November 16 premiere at The Palms in Christchurch's Shirley suburb.

Producers say When a City Falls focuses on the response of Christchurch residents to the quakes.

"At its heart, When A City Falls is a story about Christchurch's people and how they survived and coped following the earthquake.

At times the film captures very raw emotions and I have no doubt many people will find it moving," spokeswoman Alice Shannon said in a statement.

"But we also aimed to show how the human spirit has triumphed over terrible adversity, and I'm sure people will walk away, having seen the film, with a sense of hope for the future of our city."

When a City Falls, funded by NZ on Air and the NZ Film Commission, will debut in cinemas.
