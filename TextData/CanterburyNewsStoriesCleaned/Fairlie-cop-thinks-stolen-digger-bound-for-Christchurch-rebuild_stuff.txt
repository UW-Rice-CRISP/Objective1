Fairlie cop thinks stolen digger bound for Christchurch rebuild

Supplied The bright yellow 1.6 tonne digger stolen from a construction site near Fairlie.

A bright yellow 1.6-tonne digger has been stolen from a construction company in Fairlie.

Senior Constable Russell Halkettsaid the offender had cut a large hole in the Whitestone Contracting fence, on the Geraldine-Fairlie Highway, and then taken the digger away while it was sitting on a trailer.

The Hyundai digger was on caterpillar tracks and had a digger bucket with it, and it was on a grey Jetstream Transport trailer, Halkett said.

Although Halkett was not sure who had taken the large piece of equipment, he had a "hunch" it had gone to Christchurch for extra gear to help with the post-earthquake rebuild.

"It's not in Fairlie. It would stick out like a sore thumb here."

After speaking to the insurers, it appears it is one of many stolen diggers over the past year or two, Halkett said. "They are taken and never appear again."

It would have been taken between June 2 and 4, and had a registration number of Y282B.

Halkett asked anyone who had seen the digger or any suspicious behaviour to contact the police.
