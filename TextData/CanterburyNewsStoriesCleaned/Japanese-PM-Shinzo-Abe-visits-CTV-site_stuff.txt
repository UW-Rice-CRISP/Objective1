Japanese PM Shinzo Abe visits CTV site

The prime minister of Japan, who knows something about earthquake tragedy, has paid tribute to those who died at the CTV building during the Christchurch earthquake.

His Excellency Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, and his wife Akie Abe arrived at the site where 115 people died when the building pancaked and then caught fire after the February 2011 quake.

Among the dead were 12 students from Japan, who were studying at the Kings Education language school, which was housed in the building.

A month after the Christchurch quake, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan killed more than 15,000 people and injured over 6000.

Abe arrived with a large police motorcade and accompanying entourage.

Earthquake recovery minister Gerry Brownlee and Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority chief executive Roger Sutton greeted him at the memorial, where Abe laid a wreath before bowing.

A small crowd of Japanese shook hands with him as he posed for photos.

Abe also visited the Transitional Cathedral, where he was met by the Very Reverend Lynda Patterson, Dean of Christchurch Cathedral, and Bishop Victoria Matthews.
