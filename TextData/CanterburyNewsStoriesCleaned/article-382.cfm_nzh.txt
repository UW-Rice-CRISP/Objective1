Their heroic deeds of the past week earned Canterbury firefighters the ultimate compliment as they were compared to those who sacrificed their lives on 9/11.

But just as the praise came from a United States emergency worker on the ninth anniversary of the World Trade Centre attacks, firefighters were damping down a fatal blaze in Darfield, the epicentre of last week's quake.

A body was found so badly burned that they could not tell if it was a man or a woman.

Constable Chris Scott said: "This is the last thing we need. It's a terrible scene."

Around 30 firefighters and 100 onlookers gathered at a service yesterday at Christchurch's Firemen's Reserve to honour emergency workers who died in the 9/11 terrorist attack in 2001.

US Ambassador David Huebner wrote that the service, which went ahead during a state of emergency, showed an "astounding" generosity of spirit.

He said: "It is simply extraordinary that in the middle of tragedy in their own front parlour, Kiwis are taking time to remember a day nine years ago when, half a world away, others were suffering."

Paul Fiffick, from the United States Embassy, helped transport firefighters at Ground Zero nine years ago.

He said the selflessness on display was the same in both cities. "I know the firefighters in Christchurch must be exhausted. Their presence reminds me of New York after 9/11," Fiffick said.

"It is evident in the people of Christchurch. That binds our countries together."

Fire Service Acting National Commander Paul McGill said 35 Fire Service staff had lost their homes, "Yet all of them continued in their duties."

He said: "The first responsibility of the firefighters is to serve their community, and they wouldn't want to see it any other way."
