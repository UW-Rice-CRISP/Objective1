Christchurch's rebuild begins with massive $4 billion construction spend

Dean Kozanic REBUILD: Finishing touches being done to the new office block on the corner of Gloucester St, Durham St North, and Cambridge Terrace, in September 2014.

Construction in Canterbury is at record levels, with almost $4 billion worth of construction work done last year.

This was a jump of 38 per cent from 2013, according to Statistics New Zealand.

The $3.98b worth of construction in the region included $2.51b of home building. This compares with $2.8m of construction done in 2013, of which $1.6b was home building.

The last three months of 2014 saw $1.05b of construction underway in the region, the busiest quarter on record.

Canterbury was the second-busiest region for construction in New Zealand, behind Auckland. The figures come from the department's work in place survey which tracks construction underway, and differ from consent data.

Construction levels in Canterbury have been rising from a low-point in early 2011, immediately after the February earthquakes.

Statistics New Zealand said Canterbury's construction spend was almost two-and-a-half times what it was before the start of the quakes in 2010, but the trend appeared to be flattening.

Across the rest of New Zealand, more than $15 billion worth of building work was carried out in 2014, a rise of almost a quarter from 2013. Together, Auckland and Canterbury accounted for $9.7b of this.

Westpac bank senior economist Michael Gordon said house construction last year exceeded their forecast, and had rebounded in the last three months of the year after a quiet spell leading up to the general election.

Nationally, house building was at a seven-year high, Gordon said.
