Canterbury University scholarship for quake research

Students will be funded to complete Canterbury University postgraduate research so earthquake information will not be "irretrievably lost".

The first four scholarships, funded by the Canterbury Community Trust, will support masters students to research and write on aspects of the earthquake response and recovery.

Successful applicants will have their fees paid and receive a stipend of $12,000 to support them through a year of study.

UC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive (CEISMIC) director professor Paul Millar was inspired to develop the scholarship scheme because he was concerned that as time wore on vital information about the response and recovery was being "irretrievably lost".

Students will research every group involved in the recovery, to learn lessons from the way emergency services, communities, councils, businesses, education providers, government agencies and others responded.

Topics for the first scholarships would include the way many activist organisations responded to community need, the impact the earthquakes had on Aranui High School families, lessons about more effective disaster management strategies for institutions like galleries and museums, and the experiences of rebuild migrant labourers.

Millar hoped other organisations would follow the Canterbury Community Trust's lead and fund students to carry out research.
