The destruction and death toll of Tuesday's 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch has many people wondering what they can do to help.

For those in Christchurch, Mayor Bob Parker asks those who are able to help those in their community, in particular elderly and disabled people.

He says people should check in on their neighbours and help supply them with water and food.

While offers from volunteers are appreciated, Mr Parker says people should stay out of the central city.

The Royal College of General Practitioners has been asked by the Ministry of Health to establish the national emergency relief pool for general practice and community pharmacy in Canterbury.

General practitioners, practice nurses, practice managers, community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who are available to assist in Christchurch at short notice should register here.

Social Development minister Paula Bennett said there had many offers of assistance from across the country.

"Growers from around the country are offering fresh food donations, church groups are donating goods to those in need and Food and Grocery Council members are also working to get donated food to the people of Christchurch," she said.

All offers of help can be emailed to earthquakehelp@msd.govt.nz, which is a central co-ordination point.

Hands-on help

Once again the University of Canterbury Students Association is inviting people to join the student volunteer army.

Volunteers should arrive at the UCSA car park on Ilam Road between 9am and 10am and bring shovels, wheelbarrows, gloves, raincoats, sunblock, drink bottles. Find out more about theStudentVolunteerArmy on Facebook.

The Auckland University Students Association is looking to get volunteers during the university's Orientation next week to help gather donations to go to the aid of victims of the earthquake. More information here.

Accommodation can be offered to those displaced - see here for more information.

People in Wellington who can offer accommodation to displaced Cantabrians can register by calling 04 801 4205 or emailing CD.Welfare@wcc.govt.nz with details. Those in Auckland who can offer a bed can call 0800 AUCKLAND to register.

Habitat for Humanity is appealing to Cantabrians who can offer accommodation to their fellow Cantabs to place listings on www.shelter.org.nz.

The Swim for Christchurch tomorrow at Milford Beach in Auckland will be raising money for the Canterbury Earthquake appeal. People should sign up for the 1km Ocean Swim at 7.30am with the swim beginning at 8am. You must bring and wear your own swim cap. Cash donations only.

Prime Minister John Key said the best way people from around New Zealand and the world can help is to make cash donations to help the city and its residents get back on their feet.

Scam warning

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs is warning people about an email scam, which uses Christchurch's earthquake as an opportunity to prey on the good will of New Zealanders.

Ministry watchdog Scamwatch said it had already received reports of emails sent from 'James McCoy', who claims to be from 'Donate4Charity NZ'.

It suggests the recipient can be the New Zealand manager of the bogus charity in return for a 10 percent cut.

The ministry said giveaway signs of an email scam include a generic email address, poor grammar and spelling, and an offer of a cut for accepting money.
