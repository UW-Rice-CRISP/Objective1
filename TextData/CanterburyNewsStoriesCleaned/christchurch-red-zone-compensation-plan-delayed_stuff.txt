Christchurch red zone compensation plan delayed

Kirk Hargreaves Cera has delayed a plan for compensation of residential red zone property owners for another two months.

Owners of vacant, commercial and uninsured properties in Christchurch's residential red zones will have to wait another two months to get a revised buyout offer.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) was expected to finalise the proposals on Tuesday, following public consultation on the offer plan, but the deadline was extended to July 31.

The consultation followed a March Supreme Court decision advising the Government to reconsider its offer to landowners in the residential red zone with vacant, commercial or uninsured properties.

Those 160 landowners did not qualify for the original Crown offer to red-zoners â€“ a 2007 rateable valuation (RV) payout for their land and house. They were instead offered a payment of half the RV of their land.

The Supreme Court found, in a majority ruling, that the reduced offers "were not lawfully made".

Cera acting chief executive John Ombler said Cera received more than 800 submissions on the plan and he needed more time "give due consideration to the public's feedback".

"I know news of this delay is going to be disappointing for people waiting for a decision," he said.

"I remain committed to streamlining this process so that affected property owners will know the outcome as soon as possible. We are working hard to get the draft recovery plan out soon and providing sufficient time for everyone to provide comment."
