'Regenerate Christchurch' detail to be revealed Friday

JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON Mayor Lianne Dalziel and Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee are expected to announce on Friday how the rebuild power transition will work.

The power structure for running Christchurch's earthquake rebuild when Cera winds up is about to be revealed.

Mayor Lianne Dalziel and Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee are expected to announce late Friday morning final plans for how the transition arrangement will work.

In July, Prime Minister John Key announced a proposed entity called Regenerate Christchurch – overseen by Brownlee – would help take over the management of the central city rebuild from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera).

Key said a new law would be introduced to replace the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery (CER) Act, which expires in April 2016.

Called the Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill, the new legislation would run for another five years from April, and would formalise the transition of Cera's functions to other government agencies, local councils and Ngai Tahu.

The city council clawed back some power in the proposal just days before the plan was released.

Dalziel asked for changes after a cabinet paper outlining details of the draft recovery plan was shown to the Christchurch City Council days before the final plan was made public.

The cabinet paper defined the parameters of Regenerate Christchurch, which did not include the council's new development authority, Development Christchurch.

Dalziel felt that would have been "a mistake".

The mayor said earlier she hoped the council would take control of some parts of the recovery in less than five years.

Cantabrians wanted to see council and the Government "working hand in hand", she said.
