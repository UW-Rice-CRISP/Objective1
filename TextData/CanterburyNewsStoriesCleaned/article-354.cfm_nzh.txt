After months of planning, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority is today using a helicopter for the first time in the demolition of a Christchurch house.

The clifftop home in Nayland St, Sumner, has been deconstructed by hand down to its foundations, and the helicopter is lifting remaining debris from the precarious site.

Cera operations manager Brenden Winder said the debris like framing materials and wooden timber had all been taken down as normal.

However, he said because the site was so constricted, it needed to be put into bags for the helicopter to lift out.

Some of the material will be recycled, with the rest going to the Burwood Landfill.
