Earthquake Recovery Minister ponders power handover

Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee

An advisory board set up to help put together a power handover plan for Canterbury has made its recommendations to Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

A spokesman for Brownlee's confirmed on Monday the Minister had received advice from the advisory board on transition, which was established by the Government in December last year under the leadership of former Prime Minister Dame Jenny Shipley.

Shipley could not be reached for comment but she and her board, whose members include the mayors of Christchurch, Selwyn and Waimakariri and the chair of Environment Canterbury, have spent the past few months looking at how the Government can shift the functions and powers held by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) to local agencies before April 2016.

The board's advice will be considered by the Minister along with a draft transition recovery plan which Cera acting chief executive John Ombler is in the process of preparing.

The draft transition plan will outline what has been achieved in the recovery so far and what still needs to be done. It will also provide an overview of the central Government recovery functions that are proposed to continue after the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act expires and how they will be delivered.

Once Cabinet has approved the draft transition recovery plan, it will be released for public comment.

Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel said it was important that when the draft transition recovery plan was released that people took the time to read it and comment on it.

"If people genuinely want the city to be making decisions for itself, as we heard at the Long Term Plan hearings, then they have to submit that is what they want. This is the chance the people have to actually speak," the mayor said.
