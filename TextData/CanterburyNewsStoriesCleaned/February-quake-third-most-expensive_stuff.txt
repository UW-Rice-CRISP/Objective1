February quake 'third most expensive' ALAN WOOD

Christchurch's February earthquake was the third most expensive in history, says one of the world's biggest reinsurers which has calculated last year as the costliest in history from natural disasters.

Swiss Re said economic losses due to the Christchurch earthquakes in 2011 totalled US$18 billion (NZ$22b), putting them third in cost behind Japan's tsunami and the flooding in Thailand.

But Christchurch's February 22 and June 13 combined were second largest behind the Japan tsunami for insured losses of US$14b, ahead of Thailand's floods where many fewer people are insured.

Insured losses do not include the full economic cost of a catastrophic event as not everyone or every business is insured.

"In New Zealand where earthquake insurance penetration is high, particularly for residential properties, the February [magnitude-6.3] earthquake [was] the third most expensive in history," said Swiss Re senior catastrophe data analyst Lucia Bevere.

"It triggered further insurance claims of US$12b, covering 80 per cent of economic losses," she said.

The June 13 quakes led to insured losses of US$2b.

Last year saw the highest economic losses in history from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters, totalling US$370b.

Christchurch's economic losses from the February 22 quake were US$15b followed by a further US$3b from the June quake.

Flooding in Thailand resulted in the highest insured losses ever from a single flood event, at US$12b but economic losses from the event were much higher at US$30b.

The Japanese earthquake and tsunami far outweighed the other events with US$35b of insured losses, making it the most expensive earthquake on record, producing US$210b of economic losses.

Swiss Re said its study revealed unprecedented losses of US$370b from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in 2011, including floods in Australia.
