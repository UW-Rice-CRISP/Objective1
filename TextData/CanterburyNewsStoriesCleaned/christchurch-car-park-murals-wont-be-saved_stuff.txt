Christchurch car park murals won't be saved

Joseph Johnson "There is every likelihood the painted sections could be seriously damaged in the process of trying to remove them," Cera said.

Citing cost, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority will not save transportation murals on the Manchester St car park.

"The shear walls of the structure, including the south walls on which the murals are painted, are believed to have both earthquake damage and damage caused by engineering investigations," a Cera spokesman said.

"Any attempt to preserve the murals would require a ... demolition approach with substantially greater cost to the taxpayer, a longer timeframe for demolition, and more disruption to roads users.

"Even by using the more costly and disruptive approach, there is every likelihood the painted sections could be seriously damaged in the process of trying to remove them," he said.

The murals were painted in 1995 by Chris Finlayson and Dean Blundell, and yesterday Finlayson called for a preservation effort. "I'm really disappointed that [there] has made no moves to save the murals," he said.

"As the original artist, I can't believe there is nothing in place to save even portions of them," Finlayson said.

The car park buildings were currently being demolished to make way for the widening of Manchester St and the East Frame.
