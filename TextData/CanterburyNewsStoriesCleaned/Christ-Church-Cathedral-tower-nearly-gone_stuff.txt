EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE: The Christ Church Cathedral tower is almost completely gone.

Dozens of high-profile Cantabrians have signed an open letter calling for the deconstruction of Christ Church Cathedral to be stopped.

The move comes as the demolition of the cathedral's tower is nearly complete.

The tower is expected to be gone by the end of the week.

The open letter, addressed to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority, Church Property Trustees, the Cathedral Chapter and the Christchurch City Council, said the signatories, including business leaders, politicians, engineers and designers, ''oppose in the strongest terms possible'' the razing of the cathedral to a wall height of three metres.

It was ''imperative'' the groups joined forces to secure the building for the future, the letter said.

''It should be made safe, repaired and restored as near as possible to its original form,'' the group said.

Those who signed included Ballantynes managing director Richard Ballantyne, former MP Jim Anderton, broadcaster Mike Yardley and former mayor Garry Moore.

Sir Humphry Wakefield and Christopher Godley, the British-based relatives of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, one of the cathedral founders, and the city's founder, Robert Godley, also signed.

The group supported the petition signed by more than 100 senior seismic and structural engineers.

''We see the cathedral as the unifying catalyst for a new, non-partisan, enlightened appreciation of all our city's distinctive heritage buildings ... Our rebuilt city must reflect our past as well as a commitment to our future,'' the letter said.
