An elderly man who lived through the Napier earthquake says he has no doubt that Christchurch will be rebuilt as a better city.

Motivational expert Grahame Felton, 91, lost his cousin in the magnitude 7.8 earthquake in 1931 which claimed at least 256 lives.

Nearly all buildings in Napier and Hastings were wiped out in that earthquake, which remains New Zealand's deadliest natural disaster. The Christchurch quake has claimed 147 lives, and more than 200 people remain missing.

Mr Felton said Tuesday's quake was like nothing he had ever felt before and made the September 4 magnitude 7.1 quake seem like a small tremor.

Mr Felton and his wife, Doreen, live near the badly hit suburb of Redcliffs and are staying with friends on the other side of town at the moment.

"On Tuesday we were knocked to the floor and I thought the whole house was going to come down," Mr Felton said.

The situation in Christchurch was awful but Napier had been slowly rebuilt, though it took four or five years to clear all the rubble, and constant rumbles set the work back, he said.

"We didn't have all the new machinery in those days and it was slow work. "The city of Napier is now lovely and it is clean and tidy. It takes courage to move on but to maintain courage is a good esteem builder. Christchurch will be rebuilt and it will be a better city."

The hardest thing since Tuesday's quake was the inability to plan, and Mr Felton said the city needed to stick together.

"It'll come right in the end and we will come through this," he said.

"We just need to be patient and help those badly affected." NZPA
