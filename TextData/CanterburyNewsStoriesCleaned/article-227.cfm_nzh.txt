New transport plans for Christchurch reveal the inner city will have a reduced speed limit and a "people-focused environment'' once rebuilt.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee released the plan today, which specified a new 30km/h speed limit in the heart of the city.

Nearly 300 submissions were received on the draft plan - all of which identified a "more accessible and people-friendly'' city as a priority, Mr Brownlee said.

Key changes in the plan include converting Kilmore and Salisbury Streets from one-way into two-way, while retaining the other one-way streets of Montreal, Durham and St Asaph with the replacement of Oxford/Lichfield onto Tuam Street.

"Overall we are trying to make the central city as attractive as possible for people to come in and shop, socialise and live, and I'm confident executing this plan will help meet that goal,'' Mr Brownlee said.

Many of the submissions made suggestions for how the inner city streets should look, and those ideas will be considered as concept designs are developed, he said.

The Automobile Association - one of the key interest groups - had made a range of suggestions, including the removal of traffic signals in some areas.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority would work closely with the Christchurch City Council to develop design guidelines and a parking plan over the next few months, Mr Brownlee's office said.
