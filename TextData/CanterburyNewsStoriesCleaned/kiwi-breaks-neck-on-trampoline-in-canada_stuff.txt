A young Kiwi has broken his neck practicing ski tricks on a gym trampoline in Canada.

The family of Ian Simpson, 24, have rushed across the world to be at his bedside in an intensive care unit in Calgary, Alberta, where he is recovering from major surgery.

Simpson, of Tekapo, was in Canada working as a high pressure welder after leaving New Zealand three or four years ago.

A crowdfunding site set up to help Simpson and his family with the costs of the accident has raised over $10,000.

According to the site, he was likely to require a two to three month hospital stay and a powered wheelchair.

Friends, family, and supporters had donated up to $500 each, many writing messages of love.

Simpson's spinal cord was damaged between the C5 and C6 cervical nerves.

His mother Susan and older brother Angus arrived in Canada on Monday.

"We don't know what's in front of us yet, but people have obviously been very generous and we certainly appreciate that - we're very humbled," Father John Simpson told the NZ Herald.

Brad Smeele, a Kiwi world champion wakeboarder who became a quadriplegic after an accident, told the NZ Herald Simpson would need all the support he could get.

"Fundraising is probably the biggest thing his friends and family can do, but for him it's really just about having a positive mindset," he said.

"It's such a life-changing thing."

As Simpson's injury was further down the spine than Steele's, he predicted the Simpson would regain some sort of arm movement.
