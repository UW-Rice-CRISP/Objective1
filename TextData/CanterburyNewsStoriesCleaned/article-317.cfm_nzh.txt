The arrival of specialised rescue experts from China this morning brings the number of foreign aid workers to quake-damaged Christchurch to 350 from seven nations says Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully.

He said the extra help will strengthen the rescue and recovery operation following the devastating quake that hit Canterbury on Tuesday.

``We are very grateful for the contribution provided by our friends from China, the US, and the UK who have arrived in the past 12 hours,'' Mr McCully said.

``Each will provide a valuable boost to the efforts by New Zealand and international rescue workers in Christchurch.

``The Government continues to receive generous offers of specialist assistance from our international partners. These offers are under constant assessment based on the needs on the ground.''

Overseas rescuers in Christchurch are:

* Australia -- a 75-bed medical field hospital arrived in Christchurch and has been set up at Cowles Stadium in the southeast of the city. This is an in-patient facility and will draw on New Zealand and Australian medical personnel already on the ground. An extra 323 Australian police have been requested by NZ police to help with security cordon work, three have already arrived;

* Singapore -- an urban search and rescue team of 55 including four dogs arrived in Christchurch yesterday and has begun work;

* USA -- an urban search and rescue team of 80 plus 40 tonnes of equipment arrived and has set up base in Latimer Square;

* UK -- the first party of a 55-strong urban search and rescue team has arrived and the remainder is due to arrive this afternoon;

* China -- a team of 10 specialist personnel and equipment arrived this morning in Auckland and will be transferred to Christchurch later today.
