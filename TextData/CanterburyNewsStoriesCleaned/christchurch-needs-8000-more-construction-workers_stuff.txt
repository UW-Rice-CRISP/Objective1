Christchurch needs 8000 more construction workers

Bloomberg CONSTRUCTION BOOM: The Christchurch rebuild will peak in December 2016.

Canterbury will need to find 8000 more construction workers for the peak of the rebuild in December 2016, a government report says.

The additions to the current workforce of 30,000 will mostly work on commercial projects or infrastructure, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) predicts.

Greater Christchurch's labour supply for the rebuild was tight and was likely to remain that way for the next three years.

Migrants were now filling most of the rising number of construction jobs but beneficiaries moving into work were also contributing, MBIE's quarterly "job-matching" report said.

The construction sector's workload was expected to peak in the December 2016 quarter at a value of about $1.6 billion.

The residential rebuild would run at "elevated levels" from 2015 until 2018 but commercial work would become increasingly important.

In the latest quarter to September 2014, about $1.2b in construction work was estimated to have been finished, of which about half was residential construction.

The data was the latest demand and supply information on the Canterbury rebuild and wider recovery, MBIE said.

The quarterly report for Canterbury included analysis on Greater Christchurch Value of Work, Employment and Accommodation projections.

The forecasts were based on Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority projections of work to be done on the residential rebuild and repairs, infrastructure and commercial work.
