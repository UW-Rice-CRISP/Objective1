The iconic Christchurch Cathedral, one of the city's most badly damaged buildings in Tuesday's deadly earthquake, will be rebuilt, says Mayor Bob Parker.

Work started this morning to remove bodies from the destroyed building.

Up to 22 people are believed to have been buried in the rubble.

Engineers will start to carefully work on removing loose and insecure masonry to enable Urban Search and Rescue teams to search through the rubble.

The work would be ``delicate, difficult and likely to take quite some time'', engineers said.

Mr Parker said the cathedral was a stunning and symbolic building that would be rebuilt.

It was realistic to start thinking about the new, stronger city that would rise out of the ruins, he said.
