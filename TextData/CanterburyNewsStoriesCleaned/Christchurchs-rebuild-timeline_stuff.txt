By consulting developers, landowners, local leaders and recovery plans it is possible to form a picture of how Christchurch might look in February 2016 - five years after the devastating February 2011 earthquake.

An official earthquake memorial is set to be officially opened on the fifth anniversary of the February 2011 quake and local democracy could be restored as the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority reaches the end of its five year mandate.

There will be fewer road cones by the end of the year as the repair of pipes and streets draws to a close.

The residential red zone is set to be cleared and demolished by April 2014 and the Earthquake Commission is aiming to complete all repairs and settlements by the end of 2015.

The massive task of repairing Christchurch's pipes and roads is set for completion at the end of 2016, but by February of that year most of the repair work in the eastern suburbs will be complete.
