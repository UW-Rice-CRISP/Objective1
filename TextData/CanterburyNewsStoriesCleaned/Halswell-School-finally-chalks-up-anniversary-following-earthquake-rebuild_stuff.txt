Halswell School's belated 150th anniversary celebrations have heralded a new beginning.

The anniversary was placed on hold from last year so students and staff could mark the official opening of the first school in Christchurch to be fully rebuilt in the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes.

The school was badly damaged by the September 2010 quake, with eight classrooms being condemned.

Construction on the estimated $20 million project started in early 2013 and has now reached a point where the 570 pupils can benefit from the Ministry of Education's 'modern learning environment' integrated teaching model.
