Demolition man now rebuild chief

The man tasked with knocking down much of central Christchurch has been charged with building it back up.

Warwick Isaacs was yesterday appointed director of the Christchurch Central Development Unit (CCDU), a new government-led unit that will develop a blueprint for the central-city rebuild.

Isaacs has been working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) as its operations general manager since the February 2011 quake, co-ordinating demolition work within the inner-city cordon.

Announcing his appointment yesterday, Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said Isaacs had developed an excellent understanding of the state of the central city.

"He has more knowledge than most people – in fact, I'd say anybody – about the state of buildings inside the cordon," Brownlee said.

Isaacs said he felt "quite privileged" to be offered the role with the new unit.

"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help the people of Christchurch achieve their vision of building a stronger and better city centre to be proud of."

Isaacs has spent more than 20 years working in local government, including a 10-year stint as the Timaru District Council's chief executive.
