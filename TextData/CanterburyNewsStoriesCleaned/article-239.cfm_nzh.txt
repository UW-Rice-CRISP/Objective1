A time-lapse video showing how post-quake Christchurch's cityscape changed last year has been released by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority.

Shot from the roof of HSBC Tower on Worcester Boulevard, the video looks towards Cathedral Square and shows how CBD buildings were demolished and sites cleared between February 1, 2012 and January 31, 2013.
