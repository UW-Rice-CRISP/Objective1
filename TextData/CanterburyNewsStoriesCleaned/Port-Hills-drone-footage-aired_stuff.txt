Port Hills drone footage aired GEORGINA STYLIANOU

Dramatic footage of multimillion- dollar Port Hills homes dangling on the edge of cliff faces has been featured on the Discovery Channel.

A 4 1/2-minute segment shows members of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority's engineering team operating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect real-time data on cracks in the cliff face and weak spots.

A Cera spokeswoman said the footage was filmed earlier this year and aired on the Canadian Discovery Channel on Thursday. It featured the University of Canterbury's UAV and crew working with Cera on top of Peacocks Gallop in Clifton.

UAV flights helped identify potential access routes and geohazards, the spokeswoman said. The drone was a remote- controlled quadrocopter with a high-definition camera mounted beneath it.

The narrator of the documentary describes the engineers as "literally living on the edge".

"[They're] responsible for the safe demolition of homes teetering on the brink of disaster."

It refers to the ocean views afforded to these now broken homes as "one of New Zealand's most stunning sites".

The clip also uses footage from the February 22 earthquake.
