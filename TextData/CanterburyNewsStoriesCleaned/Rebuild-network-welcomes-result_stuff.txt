National's resounding win is a big tick for the Government's handling of post-earthquake Canterbury, rebuild leaders say.

One community advocate said it reflected a lack of a viable alternative, while a political analyst said it was a case of "better the devil you know".

Labour's Canterbury-targeted policies - including establishing a publicly-owned insurance company and an earthquake court - did little to sway the voters, with the party receiving less support than in 2011.

National won the party vote majority in all of the region's electorates in Saturday's election, and took 51.2 per cent of the Canterbury party vote to Labour's 22.4 per cent overall.

Canterbury Communities' Earthquake Recovery Network spokeswoman Leanne Curtis said no political party had offered a solid alternative to National.

Labour's policies were "bloody naive", but the result should not be "paraded around to show how great National is".

National offered a "top-down recovery", but one that people had come to know, she said.

Colliers Christchurch manager Jonathan Lyttle said the stability of a third-term National government would have been attractive to the rebuild industry.

The central city had a "clearly defined path" under National.

The investment sector would be relieved at the prospect of no "critical interference from a new government".

Wider Earthquake Communities Action Network (WeCan) spokesman Brent Cairns said the result was "certainly a powerful win" for National.

However, there was still a lack of focus with some aspects of the recovery, including the future use of the Waimakariri and Christchurch red zones, he said.

Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce chief executive Peter Townsend said the party vote result in greater Christchurch endorsed National's involvement in the rebuild.

"There has been no obvious disillusionment or protest," he said.

Canterbury University political science senior lecturer Bronwyn Hayward said overseas disasters had shown people became more cautious and reluctant to rush into change. This election was a case of, "better the devil you know than the one you don't", she said.

While it was hard for any opposition party to get established and become credible after a disaster, Labour should not underestimate its party vote loss in Christchurch, Hayward said.

"Labour really needs to regroup and take a hard look at what the voters are telling them when they pick their candidates and not the party. The real test will be in 2017. That will be the referendum of the recovery," she said.

The Labour candidates who were elected in Christchurch, Ruth Dyson, Poto Williams and Megan Woods, were community-orientated and people responded to that, even if they were frustrated by the party, Hayward said.
