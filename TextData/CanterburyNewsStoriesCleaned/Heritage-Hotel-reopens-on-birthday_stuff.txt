The Governor General officially opens the historic Heritage Hotel.

Christchurch's Heritage Hotel put on a glitzy ceremony to mark its official reopening and the 100th birthday of the grandiose building.

The Governor-General of New Zealand, Sir Jerry Mateparae, and Heritage Hotel managing director Jeffrey Tangtoday cut the ribbon in front of about 50 people, including Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee, Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker, Christchurch Central Development Unit director Warwick Isaacs, paralympic swimmer Sophie Pascoe and radio host Jason Gunn.

The event featured a string trio, champagne and a custom-made Heritage Hotel cake.

The hotel, in Cathedral Square's Old Government Building, had been closed since the February 2011 earthquake and, while a soft opening was held last month, yesterday's event marked its official return to business.

Tang told the crowd the hotel was the ''very privileged guardians of such an important piece of Christchurch architecture''.

The building was designed by Joseph Maddison and built in 1913.

Canterbury Earthquake Heritage Buildings Fund Trust chairwoman Anna Crighton said the building was ''undeniably [Maddison's] most impressive'', but the only one left standing in the city.

Mateparae said the building had ''seen Christchurch's history unfold'' and praised the strengthening work that had been done.

''More modern buildings didn't survive [the earthquakes] . . . and it's very special that the Old Government Building is still with us today,'' he said.
