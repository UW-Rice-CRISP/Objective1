7.38am: The Government is not ruling out a nationwide tax to help fund the rebuilding of Christchurch but will not make any decisions soon, Prime Minister John Key says.

He said the lack of economic activity in Christchurch would be a drag on the national economy but the country could cope.

"We've got the financial capacity to deal with the earthquake," he told Radio New Zealand.

Treasury Secretary John Whitehead was travelling to Christchurch today.

Key said he would consider a nation-wide tax if it was the best way to pay for the rebuild but said it was too early to think about it yet.

For now the focus remained on the rescue operation, he said.

He said there were enough people working in the rescue teams and identifying bodies and the Australians particularly had been "absolutely remarkable".

"We've got good teams and I believe that is enough. We just need people to believe we can get through this."

The delays in identification were not because of a lack of staff but because of the state of some of the bodies, he said.

"My understanding is they do have enough resources but it's a very laborious task."

Families were being notified but there was a limit as to what could be released publicly, he said.

There could be up to 65 people dead in the language school in the CTV building alone.

7.24am: Christchurch's Cathedral will be rebuilt, Mayor Bob Parker says.

He said the building, which was badly damaged, was, a stunning and symbolic building

''There is some discussion that that is a building we could rebuild brick by brick, stone by stone, we need to find some symbols like that.''

There will be a new and stronger city rising out of the ruins and it was realistic to start thinking about it.

''The scale of what has happened here means we will have to take some bold steps.''

7.21am: The army is manning cordons around the evacuated Christchurch suburb of Redcliffs.

Lyttelton police sergeant Gary Manch said the cordons would remain in place this morning, around an area where the residents of nine streets were evacuated last night.

He told TV1 this morning he was happy all the residents of those streets were safe, after either leaving to stay with friends or heading to welfare stations at Cowles Stadium.

Many people in the suburb had already left their homes in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.

However, he urged people to remain away from the area, bear with police, and respect the cordons.

"People just going to have a look are causing problems."

7.19am: Cancel Saturday nightâ€™s Lotto draw and give the $15 million to the Canterbury earthquake fund is the call from a new Facebook group.

''Call for NZ Lotteries Commission to donate this week's $12M to Christchurch'' had 2138 people ''like'' the page at 7am.

Comments on the page almost unanimously support the idea.

''Christchurch needs some help! It will cost billions to rebuild! So i dont see why they wouldnt give it to Christchurch, and if not, the winner should give it to Christchurch!'' wrote Suzy Shaddix Dobier.

Nicole Hughes posted: ''Potential winners of this prize will never miss what they didn't have.... Residents of Christchurch however, know what it is to loose [sic] everything. Lotteries commission, it is the communities [sic] money hand it over.''

But on its official twitter page, @NZ Lotteries, the Lotteries Commission says it cannot follow through with the request.

''Like all NZers we would love to help out, but we have already sold lots of tkts this week so are obligated to run a draw on Sat.''

Under the National State of Emergency Provisions, in the Civil Defence Emergency Act 2002, authorities have wide powers to take what they need but actions have to be later validated by Parliament.

7.16am: Search teams are assessing how to get into the area around the listing Grand Chancellor Hotel.

Urban Search and Rescue spokesman Mitchell Brown said that area was the only part of the Christchurch CBD which had not yet been thoroughly searched.

As time went by, he said the situation was becoming more tragic, he told TV1.

"Unfortunately the role for the urban search and rescue has been body recovery."

However, Brown said rescue teams were still looking for survivors.

"Our operations are always positive."

The top two floors of the Canterbury TV building had been removed overnight, Brown said.

Rescue teams would continue working around that building as well as the rest of the city, despite weather conditions making rain seem likely today.

"Whatever mother nature throws at us, we will continue to do the job."

6.34am: There are now ten specialist urban search and rescue teams from around the world operating in Christchurch.

6.28am: Eighty teams will be making assessments throughout the city today.

Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker said 80 teams were going out into the city.

They will knock on doors and will ask about personal health and the state of property.

"We are going to build up a far more complete picture of the city."

6.19am: Power has been restored to 75 per cent of Christchurch and 50 per cent of the city has mains water.

But Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker has warned that water usage still needs to be limited.

The last live rescue was reported on Wednesday afternoon.

"We will continue on with the search until there are no bodies to recover" Civil Defence Minister John Carter said this morning.
