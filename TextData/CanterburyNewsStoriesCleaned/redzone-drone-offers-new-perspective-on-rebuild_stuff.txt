Red-zone drone offers new perspective on rebuild

JIMMY RYAN/YouTube Drone footage provides a birds-eye view of Brooklands, a small coastal town north of Christchurch. Almost all of the town is red zoned and very few properties are occupied.

A Christchurch man is continuing his run of filming red-zoned areas using a drone.



Drone enthusiast Jimmy Ryan has released his latest footage, taken over the red-zoned Christchurch suburb of Brooklands.



Filmed over two-and-a-half hours on a clear Sunday, Ryan went through four batteries for the flight, which was shot across four different places.



"I was cutting it pretty fine though," said Ryan.



After filming the desolate area on his $4,500 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), he raced to the CBD to film the implosion of the Christchurch police station.



A week earlier, he had shot 30 minutes of footage, before a southerly change forced him to delay the flight.



Ryan previously covered Christchurch earthquake-affected suburbs Kaiapoi, Dallington, Avonside and Burwood.



While filming red-zoned areas had initially started as an excuse to use his drone, Ryan was now being driven by the idea he could shed light on the reality of the Christchurch rebuild and housing situation.



"It's a great way to showcase that, so they [non-residents] understand that things aren't right and it will be years before they will be."



The Brooklands area was particularly special to the enthusiast, who said it reminded his of his hometown in Pleasant Point, Timaru.



"It is a unique area in that it is so far away from anything."



Ryan said Brooklands was an eerily quiet area to film, but he was struck by the number of half-demolished houses.



"It seemed a bit dirtier than most of the other red-zone areas. The contractors have done a good job on other sites, cleaning things up."
