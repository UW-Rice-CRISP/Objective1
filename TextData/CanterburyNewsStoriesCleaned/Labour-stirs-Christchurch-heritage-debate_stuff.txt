Labour stirs Christchurch heritage debate TIM FULTON

It's time to remove the "extreme wartime powers" that allow the demolition of Christchurch Cathedral and other heritage buildings without public consultation, Labour says.

Labour's arts, culture and heritage spokeswoman Jacinda Ardern said a Labour government would remove Section 38 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act.

''The fact that this power remains now is an abuse of power. It's fair and right that these powers be removed,''

The policy would make the planned demolition and rebuild of the Christchurch Cathedral subject to public debate under the Resource Management Act, she said.

This type of consultation could have saved buildings like the Majestic Theatre, she said.

Labour also wants to work with territorial authorities and heritage groups on a full audit of the status of heritage buildings in the Christchurch CBD and other parts of Canterbury.

Almost half of the central city's heritage-listed buildings had been lost as a result of the quakes, with only 165 of 309 heritage buildings remaining as at December last year, Ardern said.
