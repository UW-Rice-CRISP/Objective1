Hundreds gathered in Christchurch's Botanic Gardens yesterday for a public memorial service to mark the fourth anniversary of the Canterbury earthquakes, which claimed 185 lives.

A minute's silence was observed at 12.51pm - the time the quake struck on February 22, 2011 - followed by the ringing of the Peace Bell, which is made of melted-down coins from each United Nations member state.

Mayor Lianne Dalziel, who attended the memorial service with family members of some of those who died, said the quake was "just like it was yesterday" for some.

Ms Dalziel told the crowd it must be remembered many people were still facing an uphill battle.

"For some it is unanswered questions about what happened on that day, or the lack of resolution on their [insurance] claim ... or a loss of a sense of power or control over what has happened."

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Associate Minister Nicky Wagner also addressed the memorial service.

"On this special day, we remember those who have passed on, those who were injured and every single person who was touched by the earthquakes in our city.

"And we celebrate the love and the strength of our community and we look forward to working together as we create the future that we all want for Christchurch and for Canterbury."

The names of all the dead were read out during the hour-long service, which finished with official guests laying wreaths at the temporary memorial site.

River of Flowers commemoration sites were open all day along the Avon and Heathcote rivers and at the estuary.

After the killer earthquake, resident Tim Dyer sought refuge that night with friends and family. The large group now move in together for each anniversary night. Reliving it has become a tradition.

"We don't bring anything; you have to turn up as you did on the day. So you can't bring food or sleeping bags or anything like that, you just turn up."
