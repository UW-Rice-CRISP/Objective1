Remarkable aerial photographs have been released today to graphically illustrate how Christchurch's cityscape has forever been changed by the devastating earthquake sequence.

Rebuild Christchurch has released 24 interactive 360-degree aerial panoramas to highlight the post-quake city's changes.

The interactive panoramas focus on the central business district, residential red zone, port of Lyttelton, and scenic areas.

"With most buildings that were damaged now demolished, a blank canvas has emerged where the new city can take shape," said Rebuild Christchurch founder Deon Swiggs.

"Viewing regular updates from the air enables us to see the gradual rebirth through the rebuild."

The images will be updated to reflect rebuild progress.
