Dog complaint prompts City Hall apology

MARK TAYLOR Hamilton man Talha Junaid left a household bag of rubbish at Hamilton City Council's main reception desk after his complaints about a dangerous dog went unanswered.

Repeated complaints about dangerous dogs in his Hamilton neighbourhood frayed Talha Junaid's nerves and left him with a festering problem - a hefty bag of rubbish.

Matters came to a head last week when Junaid tried to put his rubbish out for the weekly kerbside collection and was rushed by a large black dog.

After retreating inside, the 32-year-old rang Hamilton City Council's animal control office but his call went unheeded.

Junaid then contacted police who offered to phone council but cautioned the father-of-one against putting himself in harm's way.

The next day, having missed his kerbside pick-up, Junaid took his problems to the council's front reception desk and left a calling card - a sack of rubbish.

"Because Tuesday was my day off I slept late and missed the rubbish truck. I am a busy, hardworking person and I don't see why I should waste my time chasing after council staff, so I took my rubbish to their office," Junaid said.

"For two years I have been running around making complaints about dangerous dogs and the council never act. Leaving my rubbish at the council office was the only way I could make a protest."

In September, 2009, Junaid shifted his family from their Enderley rental after a dog rushed his wife.

Kelvin Powell, council's city safe manager, said an on-call animal control officer should have responded to Junaid's complaint, but did not.

"There was a failure to follow protocol which at the very less would have dictated that the on-call officer make contact with the complainant and get a real-time assessment of what happened," Powell said.

"I've offered him an apology and told him that we've fallen short in this instance. If we don't get things quite right we have an obligation to front up to that."

The council visited the house where the rushing dog came from but was told it belonged to a visitor.

Staff inquiries are ongoing.
