Budget boost for Chch rebuild VERNON SMALL

The Government has set aside $924 million from the sale of Mighty River Power shares as part of a $2.1 billion funding boost over five years for the Christchurch earthquake recovery.

The capital spending from the share proceeds will be used to fund the redevelopment of Christchurch and Burwood hospitals ($426m) and a contingency of $498m to cover the cost of the justice and emergency service precinct, and for tertiary education institutions.

That is on top of an existing $642m of funding already earmarked for the hospital developments (they get $185m) and other capital spending.

That takes total spending on the hospitals to just over $600m.

The extra spending lifts the Government's costs of the earthquake recovery from $13b to $15.2b as previously announced.

Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said the Government had recognised Christchurch's substantial needs, "not just to get back on its feet but to position itself on the world stage as a great small city".

An extra $303m has been earmarked for the Christchurch Central Recovery Plan, including $79m for the Avon River Precinct.

The Budget also sets aside funding for final land zoning decisions, CERA and education initiatives.

In total the Budget provides $500m in operating funding for Canterbury, Brownlee said.

Finance Minister Bill English said Treasury's $40b estimate of the total cost of the rebuild from public and private sources represented nearly 20 per cent of New Zealand's annual gross domestic product.
