More than $200,000 has been raised by New Zealanders for victims of last week's devastating Nepal earthquake, the Himalayan Trust says.

The Rebuild Appeal was launched immediately in response to the quake and funds would be used to rebuild communities in the Solukhumbu region, where Sir Edmund Hillary's Trust has worked for the past five decades, spokeswoman Sarah Gumbley said..

The fund total also included support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

"While it will take time to fully understand the immensity of this disaster, especially given difficulties in accessing remote regions and in communications, many public buildings such as hospitals and schools have been damaged or destroyed."

The Himalayan Trust has a team currently heading to the Solukhumbu region to assess the full extent of the damage.
