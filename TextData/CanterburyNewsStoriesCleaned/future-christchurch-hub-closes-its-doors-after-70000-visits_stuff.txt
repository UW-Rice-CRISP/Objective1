The Future Christchurch information hub has closed its doors after more than 70,000 visitors.

The rebuild information centre was established by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in Christchurch's Re:Start mall a year ago. It featured large screens that gave people an interactive view of the Government's recovery blueprint.

A mobile version of the information centre, known as the Visionarium, will still be in use. The Visionarium has attracted 40,000 visitors and is now on the University of Canterbury campus.

The Visionarium has also been used to collect feedback in affected communities for the residential red zone offer recovery plan, the draft transition recovery plan and has featured at targeted events including the Canterbury A&P Show, the Cricket World Cup, Matariki and the World Buskers Festival.
