Police have evacuated 200 properties in the exclusive Christchurch suburbs of Redcliff and Clifton Hills after cracks appeared in cliffs above the houses.

Residents in Kinsey Terrace, Tuawera Terrace and at the bottom of Clifton Terrace were asked to head towards the Sumner Beach Surf club, police said.

Police went to each affected house, and a geologist was assessing cracks in a nearby cliff that was causing concern. Initial indications were that there had not been significant movement in the cracks.

Police and Defence Force personnel have gone door to door on streets above Clifton Terrace to warn residents to be ready to leave if necessary.

The evacuation began this morning after a magnitude 4.1 aftershock just before 8am.

The evacuation came as Civil Defence closed the main road into the east Christchurch suburb of Sumner to assess the stability of the rock face between Cave Terrace and Nayland Street.

To get to Sumner, people should use Evans Pass via Mount Pleasant Road and Summit Road, Civil Defence said.

The properties evacuated were mostly located below Clifton Terrace and included Kinsey Terrace, Tuawera Terrace to the bottom of Clifton Terrace, Moncks Bay Lane, Emily Lane to Cliff Street, Main Road to Nayland Street, Clifton Road, Aranoni Track, Mulligans Track, points south of Zigzag, and Hurst Seager Lane.

A welfare centre has been set up at the old Sumner School in Wiggins Street and a community meeting is being held there at 5pm. Inspector Malcolm Johnston, Southern Canterbury area commander, is speaking at the meeting.
