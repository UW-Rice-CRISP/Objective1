Graffiti reaches new heights in Christchurch CBD

YeahNah Taggers likely targeted multi-storey buildings because their graffiti was more likely to be seen.

Drone footage has revealed the extreme lengths Christchurch taggers have gone to in order to leave their mark on the central city.

A video posted by YeahNah Productions on YouTube shows tags adorning upper levels of the few remaining multi-storey buildings in Christchurch's CBD, leaving viewers wondering: how did they get up there?

Many of the buildings have been vacant and inaccessible to the public since the Canterbury earthquakes.

In 2013, council community support manager Carolyn Gallagher said taggers likely targeted multi-storey buildings because their graffiti was more likely to be seen.

"It is likely they use whatever is available to get there - pipes, skips and utility boxes. They could be using construction workers' scaffolding which is not properly secured or ... breaking into buildings to get to these difficult spots," she said.

At the time, Inspector Peter Cooper of Canterbury Police said tagging signalled lack of guardianship in an area. Police and the council periodically focused "pressure areas".

Tagging on multi-storey buildings was "senseless", he said.

The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) does not remove tags on soon-to-be-demolished buildings, while property owners do not want to put cleaners in danger, nor pay for tags' removal.
