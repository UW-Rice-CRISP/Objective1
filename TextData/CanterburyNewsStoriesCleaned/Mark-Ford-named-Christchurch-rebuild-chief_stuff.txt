Mark Ford named Christchurch rebuild chief

Watercare Auckland boss Mark Ford will head the group in charge of repairing Christchurch's earthquake-damaged infrastructure.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee has just made the announcement Ford will be in charge of the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team.

Ford was earlier rumoured to have been head-hunted to lead the central city rebuild project, a position which was given to Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) demolitions boss Warwick Isaacs.

Scirt has been charged with bringing the city's damaged infrastructure back to pre-earthquake levels. Its task is estimated to cost about $2 billion.

The group involves an alliance of five key construction companies City Care, Downer, Fletcher Construction, Fulton Hogan and McConnell Dowell.
