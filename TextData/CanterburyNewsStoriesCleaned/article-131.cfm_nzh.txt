Two major rebuild projects in Christchurch worth close to $1 billion have been endorsed by Prime Minister John Key.

Visiting the city today, Mr Key viewed progress on the $217 million Metro Sports facility under way between St Asaph St and Antigua St, and attended the signing of a $650 million contract to rebuild Burwood and Christchurch hospitals.

Leighs Cockram JV Ltd, a joint venture between Leighs Construction and Australian company Cockram Corporation, has been awarded the contract to redevelop Burwood Hospital.

"This is an important day for Cantabrians - the day we front up with the money," Mr Key said.

Health Minister Tony Ryall said the Government had set aside $500m from the Future Investment Fund to rebuild both hospitals at an expected cost of $650m.

"It is the largest and most complex building project in the history of New Zealand's public health service," he said.
