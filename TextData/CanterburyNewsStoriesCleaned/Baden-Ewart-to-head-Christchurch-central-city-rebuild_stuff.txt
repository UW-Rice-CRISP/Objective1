Baden Ewart to head Christchurch central city rebuild

KIRK HARGREAVES/Fairfax NZ Christchurch Central Development Unit director Warwick Isaacs will leave the agency on March 27.

An interim director for the Christchurch Central Development Unit (CCDU) has been announced ahead of the departure of current leader Warwick Isaacs.

Baden Ewart will become the interim director of the CCDU when Isaacs leaves the agency on March 27 to become the chief executive of Stonewood Homes.

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) acting chief executive John Ombler said Ewart had worked closely with Isaacs since Canterbury's earthquakes and was his "second in command" throughout the demolition phase.

The pair had also worked together at the CCDU, and Ewart was a "respected leader" within the organisation and wider community.

Before joining Cera in 2011, Ewart worked within the health sector and served 43 years with the New Zealand Army.

"I am pleased he has accepted the challenge that comes with this important role," Ombler said.

The appointment would ensure the CCDU's $4 billion work programme to rebuild central Christchurch continued smoothly until Cera's transition arrangements were finalised.

Cera will be disestablished in April 2016, with its functions and powers transferred to local agencies.
