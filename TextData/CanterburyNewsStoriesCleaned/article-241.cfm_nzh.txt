The status of the earthquake emergency in the Christchurch CBD has changed from a rescue operation to one of recovering bodies, with authorities saying there is now no chance of finding any more survivors.

Civil Defence national controller John Hamilton told a press conference a short time ago there was now no hope of finding anyone alive in the CBD.

"It is with considerable sorrow and an element of personal frustration that I announce this afternoon that the operation in the Central Business District of Christchurch is to transition from searching for survivors to recovering those who have lost their lives," he said.

Mr Hamilton said the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) effort had been intense throughout and very careful, using skilled resources from New Zealand and international partners.

He said USAR had put in its very best effort and rescued 70 people from the wreckage but the last person to be pulled alive was the day after the earthquake, on Wednesday the 23rd of February

As time has gone on the chances of finding others alive has diminished, he said.

"Sadly there becomes a point where the response effort has to shift from rescue to the recovery of bodies and regrettably we have reached that point.

"We now face the reality that there is no chance that anyone could have survived this long and efforts have to shift to the recovery of loved ones and their return to their families," he said.

A small miracle could not be ruled out however and all sites will be treated accordingly, he said.

"We need to be realistic and help families through what is now a grim reality."

The families of earthquake victims were being explained the body recovery process as the press conference took place.
