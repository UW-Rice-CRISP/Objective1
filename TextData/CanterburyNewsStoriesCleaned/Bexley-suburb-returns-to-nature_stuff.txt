Bexley suburb returns to nature

DAVID WALKER/The Press A drone flyover of the Christchurch suburb of Bexley shows a red zoned wasteland, where only a tenacious few remain in an area that nature has reclaimed.

The Christchurch suburb of Bexley is almost off the map.

Fresh footage of the quake-hit community from above shows a landscape almost bereft of houses. Parts of the cleared land are lush with verdant regrowth. The grey emptiness of others is in sharp contrast.

The owners of 816 red-zoned Bexley properties have settled with the Crown. Seven hundred and fifty three of the sections have been cleared.

"It's getting much easier to live here," resident Martin Francis said.

"Before with all the [empty] houses surrounding us, people were in flogging stuff. Then the houses coming down, it's like sitting in an earthquake.

"Even the demolition trucks are getting a little bit scarce now."

Francis and wife Rae were uninsured when the February 2011 earthquake hit so did not qualify for the original Crown compensation offer. They are part of the Quake Outcasts group awaiting a possible revised offer from the Government.

"I'm more relaxed about the whole place by there being fewer houses around," Francis said.

"In fact, it's getting to the stage now where I don't like the idea of going to a place where there's heaps of people. It's becoming a lifestyle block."

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority operations general manager John Cumberpatch said demolitions were on track for all Crown-owned properties in the flat land red zone to be cleared by the June 30 deadline
