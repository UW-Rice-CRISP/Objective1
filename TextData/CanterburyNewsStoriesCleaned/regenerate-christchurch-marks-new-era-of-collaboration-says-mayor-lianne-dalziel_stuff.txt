Regenerate Christchurch marks new era of collaboration says Mayor Lianne Dalziel

DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ Mayor Lianne Dalziel and Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee announce plans for new agency Regenerate Christchurch.

Mayor Lianne Dalziel says the new collaborative working environment the city council and the Government have created though Regenerate Christchurch is a game-changer.

"I haven't felt so optimistic for the future of Christchurch than I do today," she said.

On Friday she and Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee announced the Christchurch City Council and the Government were jointly setting up a new rebuild agency called Regenerate Christchurch.

It would be tasked initially with overseeing the long-term development of the central city, the residential red zone, and New Brighton.

Other areas of the city struggling to recover from the quakes might also come in for Regenerate Christchurch's attention further down the track.

The council and the Government would jointly fund Regenerate Christchurch and it would have a board which would report to both agencies.

Both Brownlee and Dalziel said the new agency represented a unique partnership and offered a new way of thinking about how central and local government could operate in the future.

"This to me creates an extraordinary opportunity for the city where the council and the Government work hand-in-hand," Dalziel said.

"We jointly appoint a board which means that it is influenced by both and accountable to both but not controlled by either. That to me is the best outcome for the city."

The mayor said she had been critical in her 2014 state of the city speech about the Government's failure to forge a genuine partnership with the council, but believed they were now on the right track.

The turning point happened in June when the council approved its Long Term Plan, which proved to the Government that it had its finances in order and could meet its share of the recovery costs.

"It really did signal to the Government that they could have confidence in the council," Dalziel said.

The fact the council was prepared to jointly fund Regenerate Christchurch was also taken by the Government as evidence of the council's willingness to come to the table with a 50:50 attitude.

The mayor said her relationship with Brownlee was "really good".

"I can get on the phone to him, he can get on the phone to me. We communicate with each other in a very open way and we're quite happy to sit down and test ideas with each other. There is a good feeling at the moment and I think we'll just continue to build on that."

She believed other cities would look to the partnership the council and the Government had forged through Regenerate Christchurch as a potential new way of working.

"Not only does this represent a step change for Christchurch, which is what people have been asking for, it presents a potential model for regeneration in other parts of the country.

"I do think other cities will look at what we are able to achieve and - if it produces the success I am absolutely confident it will - then this could well be the model not only for a post-disaster environment but also for other areas that require a focus on regeneration and a partnership with central Government."

Brownlee is currently in China but said last Friday he was confident the new collaborative environment would deliver good results for the city.

"There has been a significant amount of discussion between the mayor and myself and I think what we've ended up with is a structure that is going to work very, very well for Christchurch. Lianne touched on the fact that this is a little bit unique for New Zealand and it definitely is.

"What we've tried to do is set up an organisation that doesn't supplant the decision making rights of Government, it doesn't supplant the decision making rights of the council but does have the assent of both the council and the Government - with the council becoming the dominant player fairly rapidly over a period of time - to make sure we do have a dynamic that delivers the sort of outcomes want people want here."
