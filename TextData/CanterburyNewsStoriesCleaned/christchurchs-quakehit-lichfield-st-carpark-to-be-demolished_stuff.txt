Christchurch's quake-hit Lichfield St carpark to be demolished

Supplied Lichfield Street carpark was damaged in the earthquakes.

The demolition of the multi-storey Lichfield Street carpark will begin later this month.

The Christchurch City Council decided last year the carpark would be demolished after its earthquake damage was deemed uneconomic to repair.

However, the demolition could not happen until reinsurers completed assessments of the building to finalise the council's insurance claim.

Insurers have now advised they do not need those samples, allowing the council to start the demolition.

The demolition, conducted by Shilton and Brown, would begin on March 30 and was expected to be finished in October, in time for the site to be turned into a temporary carpark in time for New Zealand Cup and Show Week.

Council anchor projects unit manager Liam Nolan said the council recognised retailers' frustration that the carpark has not come down sooner.

"We realise that certainty over this site is vital for the recovery of the central city retail sector and we've been working behind the scenes to progress this demolition as quickly as possible," he said.

Permanently replacing the carpark was a priority for the council, Nolan said. The council has called for "expressions of interest" in options for the site. The expressions close on March 25.

Lichfield St would be reduced to two lanes during the demolition.
