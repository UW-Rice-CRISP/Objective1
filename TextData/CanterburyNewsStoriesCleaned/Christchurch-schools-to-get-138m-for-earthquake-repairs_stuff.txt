Christchurch schools to get $138m for earthquake repairs

Dean Kozanic Banks Avenue School is one of five Canterbury schools which will benefit from the latest round of funding announced for school earthquake repairs.

The Government has approved $138 million funding for the next round of repairs of Christchurch schools.

The first of five schools to be repaired will be an almost complete rebuild of Hornby High School, beginning in September.

This will be followed by major refurbishment at Kaiapoi High School, relocation of Banks Avenue School, a complete rebuild of Linwood College, and major redevelopment of Cashmere High School to begin next year.

Education Minister Hekia Parata said Cabinet approved the funding on Monday.

"We're really pleased with the progress that we're making in Christchurch and the way that the people have embraced the rebuild."

It was particularly "great news" for Cashmere High School, which was originally due for repairs in 2018 but was included in the second wave of rebuilding because of a number of severe issues such as leaky buildings.

Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye said there was already considerable work under way on 20 major rebuilds of Christchurch schools.

"Construction has begun on the rebuilds of Rawhiti School, West Rolleston School, Marshlands School and Waitakiri Primary School.

"Pegasus Bay School opened in June last year, we're on track for Halswell School to open this Easter, and building for the new Lyttelton Primary School will get underway in May," she said.

The $1.14 billion Christchurch school repairs had been grouped into waves commencing each year from 2014 to 2022. Each wave comprised a number of school constructions timed to match population shifts as residents returned to rebuilt and new suburbs.

Work will begin at Kaiapoi High in February 2016, Banks Avenue in March 2016, and Linwood College and Cashmere High in April 2016.
