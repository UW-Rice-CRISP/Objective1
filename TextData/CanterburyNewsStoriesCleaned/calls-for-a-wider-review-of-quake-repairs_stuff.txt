Calls for a wider review of quake repairs

Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel

Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel says calls for a wider review of earthquake repairs could have implications for the city council's consenting process.

Community leaders and experts are calling for a bigger review of repairs after a Government investigation found defective foundation work.

"I believe there has to be a proper investigation into the issues that that report has raised," Dalziel said on Friday.

The comments came after experts raised concerns following a Government survey of unconsented quake repairs.

A third of the 90 properties surveyed did not meet the building code, and a further 23 had a "minor defect".

Foundation expert Bevan Craig said earlier this week consented work should also be reviewed.

Canterbury Communities' Earthquake Recovery Network spokeswoman Leanne Curtis said the scope of the survey had been "too narrow" and the findings had caused "an uproar from homeowners".

Dalziel said she would ask for a report from the Christchurch City Council's consents department " as to the implications this has for the council".

"Of course we haven't been in a position to require consents but if consents were required then EQC [the Earthquake Commission] are going to be coming back to us and asking us to review work that has been done over the last three years.

"I think that probably presents the council with significant challenges.

"If in fact there was a requirement for consents to be obtained and they weren't obtained, then that will raise issues that the council is going to have to address.

"We need to make sure we are in the position to deliver the level of inspection that is required and we need to be able to give people confidence in the quality of the repairs.

"If those repairs are not done to a satisfactory standard, or to a consentable standard, then they will have to be readdressed."
