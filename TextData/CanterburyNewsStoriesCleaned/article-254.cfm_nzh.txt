The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority has released documents relating to the ChristChurch Cathedral.

The documents were uploaded onto the CERA website at 9am, and include six engineering reports by Holmes Consulting Group between November 7 and February 14, as well as communications between CERA and the Church Property Trustees.

In announcing the release, Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said the information will improve the public's understanding of the damage the iconic building suffered in the February 22 and subsequent aftershocks, and the reasons behind the church's decision to demolish the cathedral.

He also called for the Anglican Church to release its reports behind the decision to deconstruct the cathedral down to 2-3 metres.
