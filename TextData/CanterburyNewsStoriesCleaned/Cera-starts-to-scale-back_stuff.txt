Cera starts to scale back

The scaling back of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (Cera) is officially underway.

Cera today merges with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) â€“ the first of many steps to transition the region's recovery from the Crown back to local authorities.

Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee last year said the role of government agencies would change as the recovery progressed.

"Housing Cera within DPMC will enable its functions to be wound back gradually," he said.

Cera would continue to operate beyond 2016, when the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act expires, but its functions would be wound back.

This would include a review of the earthquake legislation to decide which provisions were no longer required.

The merger coincides with the establishment of an advisory board to help with the transition of power in Christchurch back to local authorities.

Former prime minister Dame Jenny Shipley is the board's chairwoman.
