Quake claimants take the cash MARTA STEEMAN

Kirk Hargreaves NEW BUILD: Many are choosing to spend their cash on a new home.

Data gathered by the Insurance Council shows about half of the 24,660 over-$100,000 earthquake residential claims in Canterbury are likely to be settled with cash.

The data shows insurers estimate that 12,340 will have an "external resolution" that is either a cash settlement or the insurance company will fund the buying of another house.

Of the 24,660 overcap claims, about 7000 are in the red zone where the option was a cash settlement with which many claimants bought existing properties.

Insurers estimate that by the end of 2015 they will have finished claims where cash is the settlement chosen.

Many of the rebuilds and repairs being managed by insurers will take place this year and next.

The insurers estimate they will manage the building of 2170 houses and 3020 house repairs this year while 1840 claims will be settled with cash.

By next year insurers estimate they will build a total of 1490 houses and repair 2060 and cash settle 530 claims.

The Insurance Council, representing insurers, expects most of those who have cash settled would be likely to choose to manage their own repairs or rebuild in the future.

Insurance Council chief executive Tim Grafton said he thought cash-settled customers were more likely to go on to build than buy an existing house. Modern homes had a lot to recommend them.

Grafton said the value of rebuilding or repairing the 24,660 would not be known until final costs were paid out.

The Press recently asked four of the large insurers plus Southern Response - the crown company managing the claims of AMI - for information on how many repairs and rebuilds were completed last year, the value of those, how many were targeted for completion this year as well as the percentage of customers taking cash.

Some companies were not prepared to give monetary values, citing commercial sensitivity of the information.

Vero said a number of customers taking cash were choosing to manage their own rebuilds and repairs so they could make additional changes or rebuild.

Vero planned to have most customers with a plan by the end of this year.

Rebuilds and repairs managed by Vero would continue into next year.

IAG said it expected the percentages of customers opting for cash settlements as opposed to IAG-managed repairs and rebuilds to even out as many customers planning on taking cash would have done so by now.

Tower said it had observed a trend towards cash settlements which provided customers with certainty and flexibility.
