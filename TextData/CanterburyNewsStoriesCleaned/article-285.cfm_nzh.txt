Gerry Brownlee has reportedly rejected criticisms from quake-hit Christchurch residents by calling them moaners who have time to "buggerise around on Facebook all day".

The Earthquake Recovery Minister is reported as saying some residents in green-blue, or technical category 3, zones had lost sight of the enormity of the Christchurch earthquake disaster.

He was responding to the results of an online survey of 689 green-blue zone property owners which strongly criticised CERA, insurance companies, Christchurch City Council and the Earthquake Commission.

The surveyed residents, whose houses have experienced liquefaction damage and may need repairs to their foundations, were "carping and moaning", Mr Brownlee reportedly said.
