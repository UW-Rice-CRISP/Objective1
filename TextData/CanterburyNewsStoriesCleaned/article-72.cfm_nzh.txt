New Zealand artist Ruth Stirnimann has won an international art competition in Rome for her symbolic abstract work on the Christchurch earthquakes.

Stirnimann was named the winner out of 1050 international artists at the La Tua Arte Nel Sociale event, which was launched by the Italian gallery il Collezionista.

The Kaikoura artist's winning work, called Earth Grid 4, was dedicated to Christchurch.

"This is a great honour to receive this award but it is also special for Christchurch and New Zealand," Stirnimann said.

"This painting is a humble contribution to console the pain that 2010 and 2011 disasters caused. It aims to send energy, structure, strength and consolation to the city of Christchurch and its entire people."

The painting has patterns that flow strongly from all four corners of the painting into the centre, "helping and supporting new ideas for the rebuild and mainly giving strength to people, warmth and even joy in these challenging times", she said.

"I hope to show this work in other exhibitions in Italy and Germany this year, unless it is sold before then."

Winning the event was a huge compliment and honour for her art and her career and her deep commitment to her style of painting, Stirnimann said.
