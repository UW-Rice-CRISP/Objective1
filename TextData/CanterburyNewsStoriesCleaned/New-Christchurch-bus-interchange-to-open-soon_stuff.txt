New Christchurch bus interchange to open soon

Dean Kozanic The first stage of Christchurch's new central city bus interchange is almost ready to open.

Christchurch's new multimillion-dollar central city bus interchange will open in less than two weeks.

Environment Canterbury (ECan) has announced that from May 18 all buses that use the existing Central Station will start operating from the new bus interchange in Lichfield St, which has been 11 months in construction.

Some $53 million is being spent on building the interchange, which is being opened in two stages.

Stage one includes a spacious passenger lounge and the Metro info counter, as well as two passenger entrances off Lichfield St.

Stage two, which will open in the winter, includes the main entrance, shops, another passenger lounge and platforms, and covered, secure bicycle parking.

"People have been incredibly patient over the past four years as Christchurch has been getting back on its feet. Taking the bus plays a part in many lives, and we're pleased that the new bus interchange is now about to make that part of their day a great deal better," said ECan's transport portfolio director Jill Atkinson.

Metro will have additional staff on hand to guide customers around the new interchange from May 18.

Construction of the bus Interchange has been led by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in conjunction with ECan, the Christchurch City Council and the New Zealand Transport Agency.

Who will end up owning the interchange and paying its ongoing operational costs is still being worked out.
