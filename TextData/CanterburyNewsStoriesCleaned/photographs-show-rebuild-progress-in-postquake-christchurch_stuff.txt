Photographs show rebuild progress in post-quake Christchurch

Russell Charters New Regent Street before it was reopened to the public.

An ex-pat Kiwi's photographs of post-quake Christchurch have thrown the rebuild into sharp relief.

Russell Charters first photographed the crumbling inner city in June 2011 after the magnitude 6.3 aftershock, while on holiday visiting his sister Jacqui.

Charters who is from Blenheim but has lived in Melbourne since 1981, returned to Christchurch last weekend and revisited the sites he'd photographed four years earlier.

Armed with prints of the 2011 photographs and a map plotted with their locations, Charters and his sister drove through the rebuild zone to see what had changed.

"At first I thought not much had happened, but then I saw the building activity taking place - the big, multistorey stuff," he said.

"I feel for the people in Christchurch. I reckon it's going to take 20 years to rebuild."

Charters took updated photographs with his Canon 5d, using the same lenses as the original pictures, and stitched them to their 2011 counterparts.

The self-described "keen amateur" photographer said it was the only project of its kind he'd done.

"It's a bit more interesting than going there wandering round taking photos aimlessly," he said.

"It was quite fun."
