Hawke's Bay's Sikh community has handed over about $5500 in donations towards the Red Cross Nepal earthquake recovery appeal.

The funds were presented to Red Cross Hastings president Paul Hawke in front of more than 500 people at the Sikh temple in Hastings yesterday.

An estimated 850,000 or more homes in Nepal were damaged or destroyed in the April 25 earthquake. Almost 9000 people have died and about 23,000 were injured in Nepal's worst disaster in more than 80 years. It triggered an avalanche on Mt Everest, killing 19 people. More than 200 were killed in an aftershock on May 12, and a further 2500 injured.

Introducing yesterday's presentation, community member Lakhvir Singh said the New Zealand Sikh Society Hastings had contributed significantly to disaster appeals in the past, including the Christchurch Earthquake recovery.
