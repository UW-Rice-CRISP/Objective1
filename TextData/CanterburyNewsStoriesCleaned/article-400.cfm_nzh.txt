Hundreds of rescue workers and millions of dollars in overseas aid have poured into Christchurch in the wake of last week's 6.3 magnitude quake.

More than 900 international personnel from 12 countries are now working with New Zealand search and rescue teams in Christchurch, Foreign Minister Murray McCully confirmed today.

Australia has been the biggest contributor to the rescue effort, he said.

It sent 142 Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) workers from New South Wales and Queensland, 323 police officers, a 23-person medical team, three dogs to sniff out survivors and a 75-bed field hospital similar to those used in warzones such as Afghanistan.

The United States sent 80 USAR workers and 40 tonnes of equipment and the United Kingdom sent 64 USAR personnel.

That generosity was matched by Japan, China, Singapore and Taiwan, which each sent USAR teams and search and rescue dogs.

Japan also sent a team of four counsellors, four fingerprint experts and an interpreter, while Singapore has 116 Defence Force personnel manning the security in Christchurch.

The recovery operation in the quake-hit city will also been bolstered by 1000 sheets of reinforced plastic, 1000 blankets and about 50 power generators expected to arrive from Korea on March 3.

Japan will donate 1000 plastic sheets and 2000 six-litre water tanks. Australia is sending sanitation resources including camp toilets.
